# task-2-and-3
Enjoyed tackling some fun and challenging projects during my internship at SkillCraft Technology. I built a classic number guessing game to sharpen my fundamentals and then dove deeper by creating an automated Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm. Great experience in putting data structures and algorithms into practice
